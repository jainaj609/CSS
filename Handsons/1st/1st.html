        <li>Css stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li>
        <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.</li>
        <li><span class="del">Css is not neccesary</span> <span class="mark">CSS saves a lot of work.</span> it can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li>
        <li><span class="italic">External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</span></li>
    </ol>
</div>

<h2>CSS can be added to the html documents in 3 ways:</h2>

<ul class="unorderdlist">
    <li>Inline: by using the style Attribute inside html elements</li>
    <li>Internal: by using the style element in the head section</li>
    <li>External: by using a link element to link to an External CSS file.</li>
    <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However, <span class="mark">in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span> because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself.</li>
</ul>
<p>When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that class applies a style to multiple elements. ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element.ID is also special in that you can also use special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.</p>
<p>In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the element. </p>
<p>There is wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Bothe are used to tage elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
